# Go4TV - A TV Show And Movie Guidance Application Vision Statement

Go4TV is a guidance application that allows TV and movie fans to track what they're watching, where they can watch, and share the moments with others. The application also can record the user's watching history, and notify users about upcoming TV shows and movies.

The Application is primarily designed for TV and movie fans. Users can track the TV shows or movies they are watching. The application can also recommend similar TV shows and movies based on the what the user has already watched or is interested in watching. 

The application is primarily designed for TV and movie fans. Users can track the TV shows or movies they are watching and discover what to watch next. The application can recommend a similar category of TV shows or movies to the user. User can get notifications when TV shows or movies are available and share their opinions about the show and movie.

The application is also a useful tool for users who are not big fans of TV shows and movies but are trying to watch something in their leisure time. The application can sort the TV show and movie by genre, language, year, and country, which provides users with a wide selection of shows and movies.

Since the application is a guide to TV shows and movies, it does not need to store any movies and TV shows resource on the end user device. It will maintain a catalogue of movies and TV shows, and a link to the corresponding streamer. A trailer will also be provided in each movie and TV shows for the user to preview.

A basic level of security will be required for each user of the application. Each user has their own profile, which contains personal information, a list of users’ favourite/watched TV shows and movies, and users’ published comments. A user should only be able to access their own profile.

The application is designed as a smart phone application, but it will be extensible so that future release can have a desktop-based interface.

The application will be an improvement over all the current applications used to track movies and tv shows. It will enable users to check whether a particular tv show or movie is available in their current country of residence. As a result, when a user searches for a tv show or movie and they want to watch and they see it is on a particular streaming service, they will know instantely whether it is available to watch in their country of residence. Users will also find that they can keep track of the tv shows they are watching especially for tv shows that release episodes every couple of years. 

The application will be considered successful, if users prefer it over the other applications out there such as TV time.
