# Go4TV - A TV Show And Movie Guidance Application Vision Statement

Go4TV is a guidance application that allows TV show and movie fans to track what they're watching, where they can watch, and share the moments with others. The application also can record the user's watching history and notify users about upcoming TV shows and movies.

TV shows and movie fans are the primary audiences for the application. Users may keep track of the TV shows and films they are currently watching and figure out what to watch next. The software would suggest to the user TV shows or movies in a similar genre. Users can get notifications when TV shows or movies are available and share their opinions about the show and movie.

The application is also a useful tool for users who are not big fans of TV shows and movies but are trying to watch something in their leisure time. The application can sort the TV shows and movies by genre, language, year, and country, which provides users with a wide selection of shows and movies.

Since the application is a guide to TV shows and movies, it does not need to store any movies and TV shows resources on the end user's device. It will maintain a catalog of movies and TV shows, and a link to the corresponding streamer. A trailer will also be provided for each movie and TV show for the user to preview.

A basic level of security will be required for each user of the application. Each user has a profile, which contains personal information, a list of users’ favorite/watched TV shows and movies, and users’ published comments. A user with required credentials will be the one to be able to access their profile.

The application is designed as a smartphone application, but it will be extensible so that future releases can have a desktop-based interface.

The application will be an improvement over all the current applications used to track movies and tv shows. It will enable users to check whether a particular tv show or movie is available in their current country of residence. As a result, when a user searches for a tv show or movie and they want to watch it and they see it is on a particular streaming service, they will know instantly whether it is available to watch in their country of residence. Users will also find that they can keep track of the tv shows they are watching especially tv shows that release episodes every couple of years.

The application will be considered successful if we get a minimum of 10,000 downloads and users prefer it over other applications in the market such as TV Time.
