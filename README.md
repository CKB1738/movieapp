The application is primarily designed for TV and movie fans. Users can track the TV shows or movies they are watching and discover what to watch next. The application can recommend a similar category of TV shows or movies to the user. User can get notification when TV shows or movie is available and share their opinions about the show and movie.

The application is also a useful tool for user who is not big fan of TV show or movie but trying to watch something in their leisure time. The application can sort the movie by type, language, year, and country, which provides users with a wide selection of shows and movies.

Since the application is a guide to TV shows and movies, it does not need to store any movies and TV shows resources on the end user device. It will maintain a catalogue of movies and TV shows, and a link to the corresponding streamer. But, a trailer will be provided in each movie and TV shows for the user to preview.

A basic level of security will be required for each user of the application. Each user has their own profile, which contains personal information, a list of users’ favourite TV shows and movies, and users’ published comments. A user should only be able to view their own profile.

The application is designed as a phone application, but it will be extensible so that future release can have a desktop-based interface.
